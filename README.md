A public, curated-ish dump of links I want to be able to find again.

## How to use
- Start with **Links Inbox** (everything lands there first): [`Links Inbox.md`](./Links%20Inbox.md)
- Later, links get curated into topic pages under [`Topics/`](./Topics/)

## Topics
- (coming soon)

## Contributing / notes
This repo is generated from my local Obsidian vault (only the links folder is published).
